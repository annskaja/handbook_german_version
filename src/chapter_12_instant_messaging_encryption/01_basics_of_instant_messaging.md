Basics of Instant Messaging
======================================

Instant messaging is a comfortable way to communicate with each other directly. 

It is quite easy to protect instant messaging chats from being intercepted. To understand how, it is neccessary to get an overview about the places IM data is stored at

 1. Your own computer if you create logs of your conversations
 2. The computer of the person(s) you are talking to if he or she does so
 3. Sometimes the IM provider if he does logging of messages
